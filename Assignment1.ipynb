Each item can be a string.\n","2.  **Functions:** Implement the following functions:\n","    *   `add_task(todo_list, task)`: Adds a new task to the to-do list.\n","    *   `view_tasks(todo_list)`: Displays all tasks in the to-do list with their index number.\n","    *   `mark_task_complete(todo_list, task_index)`: Marks a task as complete (you can either remove it or add a marker like \"[X]\" to the task string).\n","    *   `remove_task(todo_list, task_index)`: Removes a task from the to-do list by its index.\n","3.  **User Interaction:**\n","    *   Create a simple command-line interface that allows the user to interact with the to-do list manager.\n","    *   Use a loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.\n","    *   Provide options for the user to:\n","        *   Add a task\n","        *   View tasks\n","        *   Mark a task complete\n","        *   Remove a task\n","        *   Exit\n","4.  **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling (e.g., inform the user if they enter an invalid task index).\n","5.  **Code Structure:** Organize your code logically using functions.\n","\n","**Instructions:**\n","\n","1.  Create a new code cell and start implementing the functions.\n","2.  Create a main loop to handle user input and call the appropriate functions.\n","3.  Test your functions thoroughly with different scenarios.\n","4.  Add comments to your code to explain what it does.\n","\n","This assignment should be more manageable and still provide good practice with fundamental Python concepts!"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"vk4OCUMAjhwe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756899743703,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":23,"user":{"displayName":"Razvan Alexe","userId":"13203107775572930469"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"id":"h3i0w0o7SfXI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1756899743738,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Razvan Alexe","userId":"13203107775572930469"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from datetime import datetime\n","from pydantic import BaseModel\n","\n","class Task(BaseModel):\n","  timestamp: datetime\n","  description: str\n","  status: str = \"incomplete\"  # default status\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","class Repository:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.filename = \"todolist.txt\"\n","        self.todolist = list[Task]()\n","        self.ReadAllTasks()\n","\n","    def ReadAllTasks(self):\n","        try:\n","            with open(self.filename, \"r\") as file:\n","                lines = file.readlines()\n","                for line in lines:\n","                    parts = line.strip().split(\" | \")\n","                    if len(parts) == 3:\n","                        timestamp_str, description, status = parts\n","                        timestamp = datetime.strptime(timestamp_str, \"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M\")\n","                        task = Task(timestamp=timestamp, description=description, status=status)\n","                        self.todolist.append(task)\n","        except FileNotFoundError:\n","            pass\n","\n","    def WriteAllTasks(self):\n","        with open(self.filename, \"w\") as file:\n","            for task in self.todolist:\n","                timestamp_str = task.timestamp.strftime(\"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M\")\n","                line = f\"{timestamp_str} | {task.description} | {task.status}\\n\"\n","                file.write(line)\n","\n","    def get_todolist(self):\n","        return self.todolist\n","\n","    def add_task(self, description: str):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Add a new task to the to-do list with current datetime and default 'incomplete' status\n","\n","        Args:\n","          task (str): The description of the task to be added.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        # self.tasks.append(task)\n","        newTask = Task(timestamp=datetime.now(), description=description)\n","        self.todolist.append(newTask)\n","        self.WriteAllTasks()\n","\n","    #### This function is only for testing purposes, no printing allowed in repository layer\n","    def view_tasks(self):\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Display all tasks in the to-do list with their index number.\n","        \"\"\"\n","        if (len(self.todolist) == 0):\n","            print(\"No tasks in the list\")\n","            return\n","\n","        for count, task in enumerate(self.todolist):  # Built-in function used for simplicity\n","            # print(f\"{count}. {task}\")\n","            timestamp_str = task.timestamp.strftime(\"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M\")\n","            print(f\"{count}.
